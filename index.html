      <p>Dr. Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and pioneer of microfinance, has inspired many with his vision of creating a world free from poverty. One of his most powerful quotes is:

        "Poverty is not created by poor people; it is created by the system."
        
        This statement reflects his belief that poverty is not an inherent condition of certain individuals, but rather a result of systemic issues within society, such as unequal access to resources, education, and financial opportunities. Dr. Yunus argues that traditional financial systems often exclude the poor, particularly in developing countries, from accessing credit and other financial services, trapping them in cycles of poverty.</p>
